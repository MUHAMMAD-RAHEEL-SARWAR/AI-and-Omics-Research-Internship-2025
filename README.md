# AI and Omics Research Internship 2025


**Overview**

Welcome to my portfolio for the AI and Omics Research Internship. This repository serves as a comprehensive log of my journey into the intersection of computational biology, data science, and molecular genetics. Here, I document my progress in learning foundational R skills, advanced machine learning techniques, and their application to complex omics datasets.

This portfolio demonstrates my growth in bridging the gap between wet lab techniques and computational analysis, with the goal of developing predictive models that can drive innovation in the field.

**Technologies & Skills**

*Programming Languages:* R

*Bioinformatics:* Genomic Data Science, NGS/WGS Analysis

*Machine Learning:* Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, Deep Learning

*Tools:* RStudio


**Repository Structure**
This repository is organized to reflect the progression of my internship. Each folder contains assignments, projects, and code related to a specific phase of my learning.

01_R_Fundamentals/: Scripts and assignments focused on building a strong foundation in the R programming language for data analysis.

02_ML_Techniques/: Projects and code exploring various machine learning algorithms and their application to biological data.

03_Omics_Projects/: Final projects and case studies where I apply my combined knowledge of AI and bioinformatics to real-world omics datasets.
